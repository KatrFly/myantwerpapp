# README

MyAntwerpApp is a rails website that is designed to serve as a blog for a foodie who posts about restaurants, caf√©s and other cool places in Antwerp. The posts are divided in three categories: guides, reviews and interviews. Visitors can create an account to save posts and easily find them again later. The creator of the posts can add tags so posts with a similar thema can be gathered on one page. New posts can only be created by admins.

The website is designed to be displayed on a laptop or desktop screen. It will be upgraded to a more mobile responsive design in the near future.

This repo contains only 2 commits because of sensitive information being present in the original repositories older commits.
The old repository was cloned and all .git files were removed so I could then re-init git and push the new repo out as public.
